## All 29 Tools — Detailed Guide

### Wireless Tools

---

#### 1. WiFi Analyzer

**What it solves:** You can't see which WiFi channels are congested, which networks have weak security, or what's broadcasting around you.

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to WiFi Analyzer
2. Tap **Scan** to start discovery
3. Filter by band: All / 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz
4. Review the channel chart to find the least congested channel for your router
5. Scan auto-stops after 30 seconds

The phone radio is the default. On this screen or in Settings, choose T2U Plus or PAU0A to listen for beacons on that adapter instead. The adapter does not join a network. Deauth Detector uses the same adapter session.

Open a network and tap **Locate** to follow that one access point. See [Locate](#locate).

**What you see per network:**
- SSID (network name) and BSSID (hardware address)
- Signal strength in dBm and as a percentage
- Frequency, channel number, and band
- Channel width (20/40/80/160 MHz)
- Security type: OPEN, WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3
- Channel congestion score

**Why it matters:** If your WiFi is slow, the problem is often channel congestion, not your internet speed. This tool shows you exactly which channel to switch to.

---

#### 2. BLE Scanner

**What it solves:** Dozens of invisible Bluetooth Low Energy devices surround you at all times — fitness trackers, beacons, smart home devices, headphones, potentially tracking devices. You can't see any of them without a scanner.

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to BLE Scanner
2. Tap **Scan** to start BLE discovery
3. Tap any device to see details
4. Tap a device row to open the **GATT Explorer** for deep inspection
5. Bookmark devices you want to track
6. Scan auto-stops after 30 seconds
7. Tap a device, then tap **Locate** to follow that one device by signal strength. See [Locate](#locate).

**What you see per device:**
- Name and MAC address
- RSSI signal strength (dBm)
- Estimated distance in meters (log-distance path loss model)
- Device type classification: Audio, Fitness, Tracker, Input, TV/Media, Phone, SmartHome, etc.

#### 3. NFC Tools

**What it solves:** NFC tags are everywhere — hotel key cards, transit cards, access badges, product tags — but you can't read or understand them without tools.

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to NFC Tools
2. Hold an NFC tag against the back of your phone
3. The app automatically reads the tag type and contents

**NDEF Reading:**
- URIs (with 36 protocol prefixes: http, https, tel, mailto, etc.)
- Plain text with language codes
- Smart Posters (URI + title + icon)
- WiFi credentials (auto-parsed)
- vCard contacts
- MIME type data

**MIFARE Classic:**
- Sector-by-sector authentication using Key A/B
- Tries 10 default keys automatically (FFFFFFFFFFFF, A0A1A2A3A4A5, D3F7D3F7D3F7, etc.)
- Block-level data dump in hex
- Access bits interpretation (read/write/increment/decrement permissions)
- Individual block writing

**Host Card Emulation (HCE):**
- Emulate a Type 4 NFC tag with custom NDEF data
- Your phone becomes the tag — other devices can read it
- Responds to standard SELECT AID and READ BINARY commands

**Tag history:** All scanned tags are saved to the database for later review.

---

#### 4. Bluetooth Classic

**What it solves:** Classic Bluetooth (not BLE) devices — speakers, headphones, car kits, OBD adapters — use a different protocol. BLE Scanner won't find them.

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to Bluetooth Classic
2. See paired devices and start discovery for new ones
3. Tap a device for SDP service discovery
4. Connect via SPP for serial communication

**What you see:**
- Device name, address, bond state
- Major device class (Computer, Phone, Audio/Video, Peripheral, etc.) with minor class details
- SDP service list with UUIDs and names
- SPP serial port connection management

---

#### 5. Wi-Fi Aware

**What it solves:** Sometimes you need to discover and communicate with nearby devices without any WiFi router or internet connection.

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to Wi-Fi Aware
2. Publish or subscribe to a service
3. Discover peers on the same service

**Requires:** Wi-Fi Aware hardware (Android 8.0+, limited device support).

---

#### 6. Wi-Fi Direct

**What it solves:** Transfer files between devices without WiFi or internet — useful in field conditions, air-gapped environments, or when infrastructure is down.

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to Wi-Fi Direct
2. Discover nearby peers
3. Connect and form a group
4. Transfer files directly

**What you see:**
- Discovered peers: name, MAC, device type
- Group info: network name, passphrase, group owner, client list
- File transfer progress

---

#### Locate

**What it solves:** A scan tells you a device or access point is nearby. Locate tells you whether you are walking toward that one target.

It follows a single Wi-Fi access point or a single Bluetooth Low Energy device. The large number is signal strength. The word above it is a loudness cue: **Listening**, **Closer**, **Further**, **About the same**, **Very Close**, **Quiet**, or **Gone**. A change of about 3 dB counts as closer or further. The reading is loudness. It does not give a compass heading or a distance in meters. Your body and walls change it, so walk a few steps, then hold still.

**Wi-Fi**

1. Open **WiFi Analyzer** and scan
2. Open one network and tap **Locate**
3. You can also start from a Wi-Fi row on device detail, or from **Locate** on a sweep finding that has a BSSID

The phone radio is the default. It compares one scan of that access point with the previous scan, so hold still until the next sweep finishes. Android requires location permission before the phone can scan Wi-Fi. The number is dBm: closer to zero is stronger. About −45 dBm or stronger reads **Very Close**, which usually means the same room.

On the Locate screen you can switch to a T2U Plus or PAU0A. That adapter listens for beacons and does not join the network. It compares the last couple of seconds with a few seconds earlier, so the cue updates while you move. Its number is the adapter’s signal index, not dBm: closer to 0 is weaker, and closer to 100 is stronger. If the cue goes **Quiet**, the access point may be off, or the radio has not reached its channel yet.

**Bluetooth**

1. Open **BLE Scanner** and scan
2. Tap the device to open its detail
3. Tap **Locate**
4. A sweep finding for a Bluetooth device has the same button

Locate runs a live Bluetooth scan and keeps only the address you picked. It compares advertisements from the last couple of seconds with advertisements from a few seconds earlier. **Listening** means it does not have enough packets yet. **Quiet** means nothing has arrived for several seconds. **Gone** means that address left the live set. A device that randomizes its Bluetooth address often disappears in the middle of a locate. **Very Close** is about −45 dBm or stronger: usually in hand, in a pocket, or in the same bag.

**On the screen**

- **Beep** ticks faster as the signal gets stronger, and stays silent when the cue is **Quiet** or **Gone**
- **Vibrate** adds a tick with each beep
- The trace under the meter is the strength during this locate, and the line under the number is the loudest reading so far
- **Reset this locate** clears the comparison and starts the cue over
- **Stop** ends the scan. **Locate again** starts it

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to Tracker Scanner
2. Grant Bluetooth and location
3. Keep the scan running while you move

**What is matched:**
- Apple Find My, advertisement type `0x12`, tracked by the key so a rotating address stays one entry
- Tile, service UUID `0000FEED-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`
- Chipolo, company ID `0x02E5`

**How a hit is marked:**
- **HIGH:** the same device was heard in 3 places at least 250 m apart
- **MEDIUM:** the advertisement was heard again, not yet in 3 places
- **LOW:** heard once

---

#### 22. Rogue AP Detector

**What it solves:** Fake WiFi access points that steal your credentials — the most common WiFi attack.

**6 detection algorithms:**

| Attack Type | How Detected | Risk Level |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Evil Twin | Same SSID, different BSSID, security mismatch or different OUI | CRITICAL |
| Open Impersonator | Open network using known public WiFi names (Starbucks, airport, hotel) | HIGH |
| SSID Spoofing | Network name within edit distance <=2 of a trusted SSID | HIGH |
| Weak Security | WEP encryption or completely open | MEDIUM |
| Hidden AP | Hidden SSID with strong signal (targeted attack) | MEDIUM |
| Karma Attack | 4+ different SSIDs from the same MAC prefix | CRITICAL |

---

#### 23. Network Scanner

**What it solves:** You don't know what devices are on your network, what ports they expose, or whether they're vulnerable.

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to Network Scanner
2. The app scans all 254 addresses in your subnet
3. For each live host, it scans 22 common ports
4. Banner grabbing extracts service information
5. Vulnerability assessment flags risks

**22 ports scanned:** FTP (21), SSH (22), Telnet (23), SMTP (25), DNS (53), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), SMB (139/445), RTSP (554), MySQL (3306), PostgreSQL (5432), Redis (6379), MongoDB (27017), SNMP (161), MQTT (1883), RDP (3389), VNC (5900), UPnP (1900), Printer/IPP (631/9100), ONVIF (3702), HTTP alt (8080).

**Vulnerability flags:**

| Severity | What | Why It's Dangerous |
|----------|------|--------------------|
| CRITICAL | Telnet exposed | Plaintext authentication, no encryption |
| CRITICAL | Database exposed (MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis) | Direct data access from network |
| HIGH | FTP, SMB, RDP, VNC open | Common attack targets |
| MEDIUM | HTTP without HTTPS, MQTT, SNMP, UPnP | Data interception, misconfig vectors |
| LOW | Printer ports | Information leakage |

**Device type inference:** Camera, Router, IoT, Server, Workstation, NAS, Printer — based on open port combinations.

---

#### 24. RF Bug Sweeper

**What it solves:** Hidden RF transmitters, wireless microphones, or surveillance devices in a room.

**3 detection methods combined:**

| Method | What It Flags | Threshold |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| BLE Module Detection | Common RF modules: HC-05, HC-06, JDY, HM-10, ESP32, nRF5x, CC254x; suspicious OUI prefixes; strong unnamed devices | Name patterns + manufacturer data |
| Ultrasonic Beacon | Possible hidden acoustic transmitters in 18-24 kHz range | Energy spikes in FFT spectrum |
| Magnetic Anomaly | Possible electronic devices behind walls/furniture | >25 uT deviation from baseline |

---

#### 25. Proximity Radar

**What it solves:** Want a visual, radar-style view of all wireless devices around you with distance estimates.

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to Proximity Radar
2. Start scanning
3. Watch devices appear on the radar display

**How distance is estimated:**
- Log-distance path loss model
- WiFi: reference power -40 dBm at 1m, path loss exponent 3.0
- BLE: reference power -59 dBm at 1m, path loss exponent 2.7
- Each device gets a stable angle based on its address hash (positions don't jump between scans)
- Radar auto-scales from 10m to 100m based on farthest device

**Beacon classification:** Identifies Eddystone and AltBeacon format beacons.

---

#### 26. Privacy Score

**What it solves:** Is your device actually secure? Most people don't know what's misconfigured.

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to Privacy Score
2. Grant requested permissions
3. Wait for the audit to complete
4. Review your score and recommendations

**Scoring: 0-100 with letter grade** (A+ >= 95, A >= 85, B >= 70, C >= 55, D >= 40, F < 40)

**5 categories (weighted):**

| Category | Weight | What's Checked |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| WiFi Security | 30% | Encryption strength, evil twin presence, open network count, PII in SSID |
| Bluetooth Security | 20% | Tracker presence, discoverability status, BLE device density |
| Device Security | 25% | Developer options, USB debugging, mock locations, screen lock, encryption, patch age |
| Network Security | 15% | Private DNS configured, VPN active |
| Physical Security | 10% | Magnetic anomalies, ultrasonic beacons |

---

#### 27. Deauth Detector

**What it solves:** The phone's own Wi-Fi radio does not hand apps deauthentication frames. This tool listens on a USB adapter instead.

**How to use:**
1. Plug in a TP-Link Archer T2U Plus or a Panda PAU0A
2. Open Deauth Detector and start monitoring
3. Grant the USB permission prompt if Android shows one

The Panda PAU0B is not used. The adapter receives only. It does not transmit.

**What is listed:**
- A deauthentication frame, with the addresses, reason, channel, and signal when the frame carries them
- A disassociation frame, with the same fields
- Five or more of those frames inside 2 seconds

---

#### 28. Signal Logger

**What it solves:** A live scan tells you what's around *right now*. Signal Logger tells you what changed — devices that just appeared, disappeared, or spiked in a way worth a second look.

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to Signal Logger
2. Grant WiFi + BLE permissions if prompted
3. Tap **Start** — WiFi and BLE scans run continuously in parallel
4. Watch the live feed; use the filter chips (All / WiFi / BLE / Anomalies) to narrow it down
5. Tap **Export** to copy the full log as a pipe-delimited text table to your clipboard, or the trash icon to clear it
6. Tap **Stop** when done

**What's logged:** timestamp, event type, source (SSID / BLE name), address (BSSID / MAC), RSSI, and a detail string (channel/band/security for WiFi, service-UUID count for BLE). The feed keeps the most recent 500 entries, plus a live stats row (duration, WiFi AP count, BLE count, anomaly count) and an events/min rate bar with new/lost counts.

**Anomaly detection** (flagged and filterable):
- **Signal spike** — RSSI jumps more than 20 dBm between consecutive scans
- **Hidden AP, strong signal** — blank SSID with RSSI stronger than -50 dBm (someone nearby broadcasting a hidden network)
- **New device burst** — more than 5 new WiFi APs or BLE devices in a single scan cycle, flagged as possible spoofing/flooding
- Newly-appeared devices (after the first scan cycle) are also flagged; devices that drop out are logged but not treated as anomalies

---

#### 29. Alert Center

**What it solves:** Five different detectors (Rogue AP, Deauth Detector, GPS Spoof, Hidden Camera, Tracker Scanner) can each independently spot a threat while you're focused on a different screen. Alert Center is the one place that collects everything they find, persisted, so nothing gets missed just because you weren't looking at that tool at the time.

**How to use:**
1. Open **Alert Center** from the drawer, or tap "View all →" on the Dashboard's Recent Threats card
2. Review the feed — each entry shows a color-coded severity tag, source tool, title, detail, and timestamp
3. Tap **Clear All** to wipe the history once you've addressed everything (only shown when alerts exist)

**Sources & severities:** Rogue AP, Deauth Detector, GPS Spoof, Hidden Camera, and Tracker Scanner each report into the shared feed with a severity of CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW — set by that detector's own risk/threat classification. Each source de-duplicates its own findings before recording, so a single ongoing threat doesn't spam the feed on every scan cycle.

**Persistence:** Alerts are stored in Room and survive app restarts. The feed shows up to the 300 most recent alerts, newest first, until you clear them.
